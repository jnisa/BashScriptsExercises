## **Introduction to Bash Scripts**

The intention of this repository is to set a playground to bash scripting. The goal is to cover all the basic concepts to become a independent bash script developer.

Many of the concepts and exercises will be collected from the following link: https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/

### **Exercises**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1. Hello World**

The first exercise is an exercise that is common to all the programming languages. 

The goal is to get the message `Hello World!` whenever the bash script is executed.

The solution can be found on the `HelloWorld` folder.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **2. Remove old files**

The goal of the second exercise is to built a bash script that receives two input variables:
-  `retention_period`: an integer correspondent to the number of days that the folders should be kept;
- `directory`: a target local directory that should be analyse with the intention of spot out-dated folders.

The solution can be found in the `RemoveOldFiles` folder.
